int arr[5]={2,8,18,34,5};
char ch[6]= "abcde";
cout<<arr<<endl;
cout<<ch;

This shows the basic difference in using an integer array and a character array.
If you run this code, the first line gives the address to the first of element of the array,
while the second prints the character array in a sequence like a string of characters.

This is because for character array,
cout interprets character arrays as a string terminating with null character "\0",
and that's why while initializing the character array of 5 characters,
the code requires 6 spaces (the last being the null character).
And for the rest of the types of arrays (like for int) it interprets as the address to the first element of the array.
